# 🧪 Testing Strategy

The testing strategy ensures the microservice is stable, scalable, and performs well under different conditions. It includes unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and a plan for future improvements.

---

## 🧹 Unit Testing

### **Purpose**

Validate individual components of the microservice, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases.

### **Key Areas**

- Input Validation
- Business Logic
- Database Interaction
- Error Handling

### **Tools**

- **Vitest** or **Jest** for writing tests.
- **Mocking Libraries** like `sinon.js`.

---

## 🔗 Integration Testing

### **Purpose**

Test the interaction between the API, service, and database layers.

### **Tools**

- **Supertest** for API endpoint testing.
- **Testcontainers** for spinning up temporary databases.

---

## 🚀 Performance Testing

### **Purpose**

Evaluate the microservice’s scalability and responsiveness under load.

### **Tools**

- **k6** or **Artillery** for load testing.

---

## 🎯 Test Coverage Goals

- Minimum 80% coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- Focus on critical paths such as:
  - API routes.
  - Business logic.
  - Error handling.

---

## 🛠️ Plan for Future Tests

- Add security tests for vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.
- Expand performance tests in staging environments.
