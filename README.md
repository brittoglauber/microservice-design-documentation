## 📝 Overview

The microservice performs two core functionalities while ensuring performance and scalability:

1. **POST /data**: Accepts and validates JSON input before persisting it to the database.
2. **GET /data**: Retrieves and returns stored data with support for filtering and pagination.

### **Design Goals**

- **Performance**: Ensure API operations respond within **500ms**.
- **Scalability**: Handle millions or billions of records with minimal performance degradation.
- **Reliability**: Support a large number of concurrent users through horizontal scaling.

### 5. **Testing Strategy**

- Defines a comprehensive testing approach:
  - **Unit Tests**: Validate core functionalities (e.g., input validation, database operations) using **Vitest** or **Jest**.
  - **Integration Tests**: Verify API flows and component interactions using **Supertest**.
  - **Performance Tests**: Assess API performance under load using tools like **k6** or **Artillery**.
- Sets coverage goals and plans for future testing improvements.

### 6. **Future Roadmap**

- Suggests optimizations to improve performance, monitoring, and cost-efficiency:
  - **Asynchronous Queues**: Use **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for heavy tasks.
  - **Monitoring**: Integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for system metrics.
  - **Cost Optimization**: Leverage **AWS spot instances** for reduced infrastructure costs.
